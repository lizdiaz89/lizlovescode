        <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freecodecamp</a>
        <p>I highly recomend checking this website out. You can learn many programing lanuages. (e.g. Javascript, HTML, CSS, PYTHON,...and more.) Also freecodecamp lets you code along while learn. If you don't understand a lesson or have trouble completing the task on a lesson you have the ability to watch a tutorial of the lesson, which I find pretty cool and extremely helpful. This website is worth checking out and been very helpful during the beginning stages of my coding journey. They do have a youtube so I extremely recomend subscribing to their channel.</p>

        <h3>Coding for Beginners</h3>

        <p> I took these two seperated courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">udemy</a>, and it is a paid course, but honestly it was worth buying. These courses give in depth lectures about the fundementals of coding and tutorials on HTML, CSS, & PYTHON. I paid for this course because I trying to brush up on my HTML skills and I also want a better "stuctured" understanding on what path I should take on my web development journey. I recomend checking this course out, the courses on Udemy are cheap and they offer deals for new subscribers.</p>

      <h3>Fullstack Web Development</h3>
      <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12638830#questions">Fullstack Web Development</a> <p>This is another paid course I am currently taking on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/".>udemy</a> and this course teaches you both front end and back end Web Development. The instructor in this course is extremely knowledgeable. Honestly what I liked about this course is that the instructor gives challenages and quizes, and I feel like it pushed me and motivated me more to code and to learn on my own versus relying solely on following tutorials,</p>
